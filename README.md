# Lending Club Case Study
> Lending Club, a consumer finance marketplace specializing in offering a variety of loans to urban customers, faces a critical challenge in managing its loan approval process. When evaluating loan applications, the company must make sound decisions to minimize financial losses, primarily stemming from loans extended to applicants who are considered "risky."

These financial losses, referred to as credit losses, occur when borrowers fail to repay their loans or default. In simpler terms, borrowers labeled as "charged-off" are the ones responsible for the most significant losses to the company.

The primary objective of this exercise is to assist Lending Club in mitigating credit losses. This challenge arises from two potential scenarios:

- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

## General Information
### Objectives
The objective is to find out the categories of applicants who can be possible defaulters of loans, which enables the firm  to reduce credit losses. This case study was conducted to achieve the goal through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using the provided Loans dataset.

The company wants to understand the driver variables behind loan default.

The primary objective of this exercise is to assist Lending Club in mitigating credit losses. This challenge arises from two potential scenarios:

- If the applicant is likely to repay the loan, then not approving the loan results in a loss of business to the company
- If the applicant is not likely to repay the loan, i.e. he/she is likely to default, then approving the loan may lead to a financial loss for the company

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The company has to revisit its interest rates for loan amounts as the higher number of defaulters have high-interest rates
- It is good to carry out a stringent verification process as the majority of the defaulters are verified or source verified
